# Sorting Visualiser - By Rahul 

This is a real-time visualisation tool for popular sorting algorithms built using Python and Pygame. It was created as a personal project to understand how different sorting techniques work step-by-step, practice structuring larger codebases, using version control with Git, and working with graphical libraries. 

## Purpose 

Sorting algorithms sound like the most complex thing in the world when you have your friend explain them to you. This project helps bring them to life visually by showing how the list changes, in real time. 

## Features 

- Visualises three sorting algorithms: 
    - bubble sort 
    - insertion sort
    - selection sort 
- Real time animation using Pygame 
- Instructions and active sort name displayed on screen 
- Simple codebase 

## Controls 

- 'UP' arrow: Randomise the array
- 'I' - Start insertion sort 
- 'B' - Start bubble sort 
- 'S' - Start selection sort 

You can watch the bars rearrange in real time according to the algorithm you select. 

## Preview 

## Requirements 

- Python 3.10+ 
- 'pygame' library 

Install pygame using pip if needed
